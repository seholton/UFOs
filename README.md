The overview is to analys UFO sighting and filter sighting for multiple criteria (city, state, country, and shape) using JavaScript and HTML.

Results
-
The result is this webiste where the user can get info on different uFO sighting and seach sighting by city, state, country, and shape)


Summary
-
The filters and parameters are vague, inflexble, and do not produce the best and most user friendly results. I recommend creating more scpefic criteria for the sighting.
